        <h1>A Message from the Heart</h1>
        <p>
            I never wanted things to end up this way.<br>
            I realize now how much my words and actions have affected you,<br>
            and that’s the last thing I ever wanted.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I respect your feelings, and I understand why you’re hurt.<br>
            If I could go back in time and fix everything, I would.<br>
            But all I can do now is be honest and hope you know<br>
            that I never meant to hurt your self-respect.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I can’t force anything to change, and I won’t try to.<br>
            But please know that I truly value the bond we had,<br>
            and if there ever comes a moment when we can talk again,<br>
            I will be here, always willing to listen.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            No matter what happens, I will always respect the memories we shared.<br>
            I just hope, one day, you’ll know that none of this was ever intentional.<br>
            And that, in my heart, you will always be someone I cherish.<br>
        </p>
